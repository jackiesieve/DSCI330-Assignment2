<p>First in the Midwest
Winona State University has created the first undergraduate program in Data 
Science in the upper Midwest.
This degree program requires knowledge from statistics, computer science,

consultation with several industry partners which ensures graduates will have
the skills necessary to meet the rapidly growing demand for data scientists.
